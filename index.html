      <p>
        I have many hobbies and interests but some of my main ones include health and fitness, playing the guitar, piano and even writing music. I tend to have a fixed personality when it comes to certain things: I still play the same old video game that's been outdated for over 10 years...where's my call of duty: Black Ops 1 folks at! Also tend to wind down with various puzzle type games such as minesweeper and sudoku. I really like the "Escape Room" type games as well and would really like to try an in-person! Also, I wouldn't be a true 'Oregonian' if I didn't like the outdoors, so I have to put Hiking into the mix. I've been able to hike sections of the Pacific Crest Trail but still have more ground to cover. One of my personal bucket-list items is to thru-hike the whole trail, starting at California-Mexico border all the way up to Canada. Many have tried, and those that have succeeded usually take around six months to complete, so I'll have to plan this out fairly well.

      <p>
        One of my main 'bucket-list' goals was to thru-hike the PCT, and that will take a lot out of me if I'm ever able to do it. Some short term goals would just be to graduate Code Fellows with the understanding and confidence of being a Software Developer. This is a fairly drastic change in career for me, but if I can secure gainfull employment with a company that shares similar, meaningfull values, that would be a win for me. If not, simply having this experience in education will be beneficial. I'm also in a better position now, financially, than I have been, and when the market is right and my career path goal is filled, I'll be ready to purachase my first home.
